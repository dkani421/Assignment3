      <h3>Project Description and Requirements</h3>
      <p>
         Part 3 of this project marks the development of an online computer store where customers can customize computers and place orders. The application is designed using ASP.NET in C# as the server-side language.
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>Research and Analysis: Begin by studying the design and functionalities of popular online stores like Bestbuy.CA and Amazon.CA.</li>
         <img src="./shared/WebsiteBasicLayout.png">
         <li>Design and Interface: Based on my research, I analyzed the requirements of the online store, Developed a design that features a realistic web browser-based interface. The design includes a store name, logo, navigational menus, buttons, and essential pages such as a welcome page, contact page, and feedback form.</li>
         <li>Computer Listings: The online store showcases a list of computers, along with lists of various components (RAM, hard drive, CPU, display, OS, soundcard, etc.) that customers can review.</li>
         <li>Customization: Customers can select a computer with its default configuration and pricing. The application will allow customers to customize the computer by changing components. The replacement will occur from a list of compatible components.</li>
         <li>Dynamic Price Update: Whenever a customer makes a change to the computer's configuration, the total price should be dynamically recalculated and displayed within the online store, integrated into the page layout (not as a pop-up).</li>
         <li>Order Summary: After a customer confirms their selections, such as clicking "Buy" or "Add to Cart," a summary of the chosen components, customized configuration, and the associated pricing will be displayed in the browser window.</li>
         <li>Temporary Storage: Orders placed by customers use Cookies to store and track customer selections temporarily.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Implementation Documentation</h3>
      <p>
         The implementation of Part 3 includes the following steps:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>Design Approach: Designed an intuitive and user-friendly web interface that emulates a real online store.</li>
         <li>Component Lists: Incorporated the list of computers and component options into the HTML or program files.</li>
         <li>Customization Logic: Develop the logic for customer customization, ensuring compatibility and accurate pricing adjustments.</li>
         <li>Order Summary Display: Design and program the display of the order summary, featuring selected components and pricing.</li>
