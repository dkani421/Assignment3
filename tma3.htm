      <h3>Project Description and Requirements</h3>
      <p>
         For this project, I developed a web application using MySQL and PHP to provide an online bookmarking service to users on the Internet.
         The site allows for the saving and editing of bookmarks and also lets the user see the top 10 bookmarks saved by all.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Analysis and Design</h3>
      <p>
         To accomplish the requirements of Part 1, I followed the following analysis and design approach:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>Requirement analysis: I thoroughly analyzed the project requirements to identify the key features and functionalities of the web application.</li>
         <li>Interface design: I designed a thoughtful interface with menus and navigation buttons to enhance user experience and ensure ease of use.</li>
         <li>Database design: I created a database structure to store and manage the user's bookmark data efficiently.</li>

      <h2><a href="./part2/index.php">Project 2: Part 2</a></h2>
      <h3>Project Description and Requirements</h3>
      <p>
         In Part 2 of the assignment, I developed a small-scale online learning management system (LMS) that can be used to deliver online courses to learners. The requirements included the following aspects:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>Designing a subject matter expert (SME)-friendly language (Educational Markup Language - EML) for marking up educational materials. <p>EML formatting: <a href="/teacherInput.eml">teacherInput.eml</a></p></li>
         <li>Storing the course contents on the web server using a database for efficient management and retrieval. <p>Database creation: <a href="/database_creation.sql">database_creation.sql</a></p></li>
         <li>Implementing a user management module for learner registration and login.</li>
         <li>Allowing learners to view and select lessons within the system.</li>
         <li>Developing a parser in PHP to translate EML content into HTML for storage and proper rendering.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Analysis and Design</h3>
      <p>
         To successfully meet the requirements of Part 2, I followed an analysis and design approach:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>System analysis and design: I conducted a comprehensive analysis of the requirements, considering the data flow, functional modules of the learning management system, and the relationships among these modules. I also designed the system layout within the browser's window to ensure a seamless user experience.</li>
         <li>Educational Markup Language (EML): I designed an EML that is user-friendly for subject matter experts (SMEs) to create educational materials. The EML included tags and their intended purposes, along with examples to aid in understanding and usage.</li>
         <li>Database design: I designed the database structure to efficiently store information about courses, units, lessons, quizzes, learners, and other learning objects such as images, audio, and video files. The design included appropriate fields to identify the course and unit to which each lesson or quiz belongs.</li>
         <li>Parser design: I implemented a PHP parser that retrieves the EML content from the database and translates it into HTML documents for proper rendering on a web browser.The parser was designed using PHP's regular expression functions for pattern matching and string replacement, ensuring accurate conversion from EML to HTML.
    
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Implementation Documentation</h3>
      <p>
         The implementation of Part 2 involved the following steps:
      </p>
      <ol>
         <li>Front-end development: I utilized HTML and CSS to create the user interface for the learning management system. The interface was designed to be visually appealing and intuitive, providing a seamless learning experience.</li>
         <li>Back-end development: PHP was used to implement the user management module, allowing learners to register and obtain accounts within the system. Additionally, the backend was responsible for retrieving and delivering the course contents to the web browser, utilizing the parser to translate EML content into HTML for proper rendering.</li>
         <li>Database integration: MySQL was used to store and manage various aspects of the learning management system, including course information, unit details, lesson and quiz content, learner data, and other associated learning objects such as images, audio, and video files. SQL scripts were provided to create the necessary tables and PHP files were developed to access the database for seamless integration.</li>
      </ol>
